                            My goal is to complete free certifications like
                            HackerRank skill badges (e.g., Python, Java, or

                            strengthen my coding and problem-solving abilities.
                            Additionally, I plan to pursue Google’s free
                            certifications, such as the Google Cloud
                            Fundamentals, to gain foundational knowledge in
                            cloud computing. Beyond certifications, I also plan
