        The CircuitBreak event, hosted by the Computer Society, is a fantastic
        year-end celebration that brings together members to reflect on the
        yearâ€™s achievements and enjoy a night of fun. I had an incredible time
        connecting with fellow members, sharing experiences, and participating
        in team-building activities. From friendly competitions to lively
        conversations, it was a perfect mix of celebration and camaraderie,
        reminding me why being part of the society is such a rewarding
        experience.
